# partialPeriodicSpatialPatterns
Way to execute:
python3 partialSpatialPeriodicPatterns.py %MaxIAT% %minPS% %input(temporal data file)% %input(neighbourhood file)% %outfile(where intresting patterns will be written)%

Here we have provided the data T10 where it is transformed to datat10.txt after adding temporal information to the data and its 
neighbourhood file are there in the same folder as dist_*dist_threshold*.txt which is generated from nbhextracter.py(ecclidean distance is taken to consideration here)and coordinates.txt(spatial information of points) present in the same folder
